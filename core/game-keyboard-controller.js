/**
 * Gives the current state of the typing keys.
 *
 * CASING:
 * Upper case keys are tracked in down/up/active to ensure expected handling for the developer.
 * If a user presses "w" then "Shift" then releases "W", only the upper case key would be cleared.
 * There would be an active "w" key that is not cleared.
 * To avoid this, the upper case version of the key is tracked instead.
 *
 * ORDER:
 * We want all key presses to be captured and handled by the game loop tick.
 * This means the game loop tick needs to handle clearing the key up/down state.
 * Otherwise, if we clear down state on key up, we could do so before the next tick fires.
 * This causes some key presses to happen without the game reacting to them.
 * Because of this, we only set key values to true here, never false.
 * TODO: This should be handled by a stack of key presses, not a single value.
 *       This would allow for multiple key presses to be handled in a single tick.
 *       This would also allow for key presses to be handled in the order they were pressed/released.
